## React Native + Expo App: Daily Reality Check

A native mobile application built using React Native, Expo, and TypeScript that delivers daily grounding messages to keep users anchored in reality. Unlike traditional affirmation apps that feed feel-good messaging, this application serves up truth-based reflections designed to maintain perspective and emotional balance. React Native handles the cross-platform mobile development, Expo provides the development framework and native device APIs, while TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the codebase. This project was created as a school assignment and will not be developed further.
