## React Native + Expo App: Daily Reality Check

A native mobile application built using React Native, Expo, and TypeScript that delivers daily grounding messages to keep users anchored in reality. Unlike traditional affirmation apps that feed feel-good messaging, this application serves up truth-based reflections designed to maintain perspective and emotional balance. React Native handles the cross-platform mobile development, Expo provides the development framework and native device APIs, while TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the codebase. This project was created as a school assignment and will not be developed further.

Additional Functionality: Harry Potter Spells Listing

The application also includes functionality to fetch and display spells from the Harry Potter universe. Spell data (name, description, and effect) is retrieved from an external API and rendered directly in the UI using a simple array mapping approach.
